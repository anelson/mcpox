description: Test the behavior when a request with a duplicate ID is sent while another request with the same ID is still pending
steps:
  - c: { jsonrpc: "2.0", method: sleep, id: 1, params: { seconds: 1 } }
  - c: { jsonrpc: "2.0", method: sleep, id: 1, params: { seconds: 1 } }

  # That second request re-using the ID should be rejected, but we can't use that ID
  # in the error response because there's a legit request outstanding using it.
  # So to help with debugging if this error ever happens, we preserve the request ID
  # in the error details.
  - s:
      {
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        error:
          {
            code: -32600,
            message: "Duplicate request ID",
            data: { duplicated_request_id: 1, method: sleep },
          },
        id: null,
      }
  - s: { jsonrpc: "2.0", result: null, id: 1 }
