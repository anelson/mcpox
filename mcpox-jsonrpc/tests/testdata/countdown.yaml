steps:
  # Start a countdown with 3 seconds
  - c:
      {
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        method: countdown,
        params: { seconds: 3 },
        id: 1,
      }

  # Server sends first progress notification after 1 second
  - s:
      {
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        method: "countdown/progress",
        params: { elapsed: 1, remaining: 2 },
      }

  # Server sends second progress notification after 2 seconds
  - s:
      {
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        method: "countdown/progress",
        params: { elapsed: 2, remaining: 1 },
      }

  # Server sends third progress notification after 3 seconds
  - s:
      {
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        method: "countdown/progress",
        params: { elapsed: 3, remaining: 0 },
      }

  # Server finally sends the response to the original method call
  - s: { jsonrpc: "2.0", result: null, id: 1 }
